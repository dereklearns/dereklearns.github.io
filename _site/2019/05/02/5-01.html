<p>We will be checking on our bunnies from time to time so it only makes sense for us to put the loop into a function.</p>

<p>{python highlight}
def display_bunnies(bunnies):
‘'’doc string list &gt; print’’’
for bunny in bunnies:
    print bunny</p>

<p>{highlight}</p>

<p>I want to create a bunch of imaginary bunnies, because…why not? You do too, right…? It will take a lot of time to write out each name for all our bunnies and that wouldn’t be practical (or fun) if we needed to name thousands of bunnies. Let’s read a file full of names and pick one at random to assign to our bunnies. Here’s how we will do it.</p>

<p>{python highlight}</p>

<p>names = []
with open(filename, ‘r’) as f:</p>

<p>for line in f:</p>
<h1 id="this-loops-through-the-nametxt-and-adds-each-one-to-our-list">This loops through the name.txt and adds each one to our list</h1>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>names.append(line.strip())
</code></pre></div></div>

<h1 id="creating-100-bunnies-with-a-random-name">Creating 100 bunnies with a random name</h1>
<p>for _ in range(100):
    random_name = random.choice(names)
    bunnies.Bunny(random_name)</p>

<p>display_bunnies(bunnies)</p>

<p>{highlight}</p>

<p>It seems that if we have 100 bunnies, they don’t quite all fit on the console anymore using our print statement. Let’s write our bunnies to a text file so we can scroll through and check on our bunnies at our own leisure.</p>

<p>{python highlight}</p>

<p>with open(‘mybunnies.txt’, ‘w’) as f:
    for bunny in bunnies:
        f.write(bunny or bunny.name)</p>

<p>{highlight}</p>

<p>Now, we can check out all our imaginary bunnies in our file named <code class="highlighter-rouge">mybunnies.txt</code>.</p>

<p>To spice up things a little bit, we can add male and female bunnies. We would want our bunnies to that are male to have male names and our females to have female names. Accomplishing this task is easier than it sounds. We need to do two things first. We need to add <code class="highlighter-rouge">gender</code> to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">__init__</code> method and grab and download female_names.txt &amp; male_names.txt.</p>

<p>{python highlight}</p>

<p>for _ in range(50):
    Bunny</p>
