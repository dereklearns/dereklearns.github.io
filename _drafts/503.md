To spice up things a little bit, we can add male and female bunnies. We would want our bunnies to that are male to have male names and our females to have female names. Accomplishing this task is easier than it sounds. We need to do two things first. We need to add `gender` to the `__init__` method and grab and download female_names.txt & male_names.txt.
